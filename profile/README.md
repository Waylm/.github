## 🌍 What is Waylm?
Waylm is a growing **ecosystem** of apps and tools.  
Our goal: one account, everywhere — secure **single sign-on (SSO)** and seamless access across all services.

Think of it as your **digital hub**:
- 🔐 **Way ID** → your universal login, identity, and security  
- 💳 **Way Pay** → frictionless payments across apps and services  
- 📦 **Way Drive** → storage and sync for all your files  
- 💬 **Way Chat** → messaging and collaboration  
- 📊 **Way Insights** → analytics and dashboards  

> All connected. All powered by your **Waylm account**.

## 🚀 Vision
- One sign-in = access to everything  
- Apps built to **work together by design**  
- Open for developers to extend with SDKs and APIs  
- Secure by default with modern identity (MFA, passkeys, WebAuthn)  

<hr>

## 🛠️ For Developers
We’re building an ecosystem where developers can **plug into Waylm**.  
Future plans include:
- SDKs for web, mobile, and backend  
- OAuth / OIDC identity layer (**Way ID**)  
- Payment APIs (**Way Pay**)  
- Integrations with popular services  

Stay tuned — documentation and SDKs coming soon.
